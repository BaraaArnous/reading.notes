# expression and operator in javascript #
**An expression is any valid unit of code (made of a set of literals, variables, operators, and other simpler expressions) that produces a value when resolved. An expression can be as simple as a variable name that equals whatever value we assigned to it (like x = 5)**.

## As you likely already know, the value we assign to our variable can be anything from a number, to a string, to a boolean ##.

** There are  five categories of expressions; The first three are fairly simple, while the last two are a little more complex.
JavaScript operators
Now that we’ve seen what expressions can do, it’s time to jump into talking about operators. Operators are used to build complex expressions entirely out of simpler expressions. We’ll explain more below **.

Operators are the tools we use to generate right-hand-side (RHS) values. They can be as simple as the addition operator — a + b = c where the generated right-hand-value is c — or a bit trickier where a conditional operator, for instance, is used: (c > a) ? "c is greater than a": "c is not greater than a".

There are three types of operators: unary, binary, and ternary. In the following sections, we’ll discuss all three with simple, easy-to-follow examples.
