# loops and iteration #
**loops allow programs to perform repetitive tasks, such as iterating through an array, while adhering to the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). They come in handy when you want to execute a function a number of times, using different sets of inputs each time*.

 ### loop is used for executing a block of statements repeatedly until a particular condition is satisfied. For example, when you are displaying number from 1 to 100 you may want set the value of a variable to 1 and display it 100 times, increasing its value by 1 on each loop iteration ###

 *in JavaScript we have the following looping statements: while - loops through a block of code while a condition is true. do... while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop while a condition is true*.

*javaScript now supports five different types of loops: while — loops through a block of code as long as the condition specified evaluates to true. do… while — loops through a block of code once; then the condition is evaluated*.

 ### iteration methods operate on every item in an array, and often perform a new function. We went over how to loop through arrays, change the value of each item in an array, filter and reduce arrays, and find values and indices. To review the basics of arrays, read Understanding Arrays in JavaScript ###.
